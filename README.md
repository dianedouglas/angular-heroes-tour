The master branch of this repo is a skeleton. Other branches walk through various tutorials. The misspelled heros branch here goes through the tutorial on the angular2 docs.

From the docs:
Every Angular app has at least one root component, conventionally named AppComponent, that hosts the client user experience.

Components are the basic building blocks of Angular applications. A component controls a portion of the screen — a view — through its associated template.

Master-details pattern.
